# Plan Review

When creating any plan (through plan mode or otherwise), run `cursor planname.md` after writing the plan file so the user can review and modify it before proceeding.

# Code Quality Standards

All code written must adhere to the following software engineering best practices:

## Clean Code Principles
- Code must be clean, readable, and easy to understand
- Use meaningful and descriptive variable, function, and class names
- Keep functions and methods focused and concise
- Write self-documenting code that minimizes the need for comments

## Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function, class, or module should have one clear purpose
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication; extract common logic into reusable functions
- **Easy to Modify**: Design code to be flexible and adaptable to future changes
- **Easy to Extend**: Use patterns that allow adding new functionality without modifying existing code

## Maintainability
- Prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term convenience
- Write code that other developers (or your future self) can easily understand and modify
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-organized
- Follow established project conventions and patterns consistently

## Software Engineering Best Practices
- Write modular, loosely coupled code
- Handle errors appropriately and predictably
- Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
- Follow language-specific idioms and conventions
- Prefer composition over inheritance where appropriate
- Keep complexity low; favor simple solutions over clever ones
